# "Fixes" Bedrock players running into lagback issues on certain blocks by removing any collision detection from the given block.
# Caveats: a custom client - Java or Bedrock - could take advantage of no collision and walk right through.
# Additionally, placement of these blocks on both platforms may be buggier than usual.

# Fixes Bedrock players being unable to control pigs and striders by controlling their movement serverside.
# Java Edition controls pigs and striders on the client end. Bedrock depends on the server.
# This option should be relatively safe but does modify server behavior. Geyser or Floodgate must be installed, as well as a recent server version.
