default pattern suffix: "(\\s|$)"
# the suffix that is appended after all patterns

default deny message: "&cUnknown or incomplete command"
# the deny message if no filter specific message is set

default type: restrictedwhitelist
# the default type used for all filters unless defined
# built-in types:
#   whitelist:
#     A whitelist allows commands that match the filter, blocking everything else.
#     The filters' permission is used to bypass it.
#   blacklist:
#     A blacklist denies commands that match the filter, allowing everything else.
#     The filters' permission is used to bypass it.
#   restrictedwhitelist:
#     Same as whitelist however the filter only applies to users who have its permission.
#   restrictedblacklist:
#     Same as blacklist however the filter only applies to users who have its permission.

default actions:
  whitelist:
    allow: soft_allow
    deny: soft_deny
  blacklist:
    allow: soft_allow
    deny: soft_deny
  restrictedwhitelist:
    allow: soft_allow
    deny: soft_deny
  restrictedblacklist:
    allow: soft_allow
    deny: soft_deny
# this is for configuring the default actions of filters.
# actions are what the filter does when it matches or doesn't match something.
# some actions are terminal and some are intermediate.
#   what's the difference?
#     terminal actions will stop execution and set the result.
#     intermediate actions will set the result but continue executing other filters (if any)
#   this is useful for both optimizing performance and for better usability.
# All terminal actions: DENY, ALLOW
# All intermediate actions: SOFT_DENY, SOFT_ALLOW, NONE

root filter permission: "tau.cmdblock.filter"
# this permission is the base permission appended before the filters name
# so filter "foo" would become "light.protect.cmd.filter.survival"

permission cache millis: 100
# the amount of time in milliseconds we should cache the responses of the permission plugin
#  due to the nature of this plugin it can query thousands of permissions each time a player connects to a server.
#  this can be unnecessarily taxing for inefficient permissions plugins
